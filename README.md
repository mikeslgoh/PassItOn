# Pass It On
MADE DURING NWHACKS-2020

## Purpose
The mobile app is designed to help connect potential donors to organizations that are requesting the type of donations being offered. Users can input the type of contribution they would like to make, whether it be monetary, time, or physical items. The application will then match the type of donation to local organizations, empowering users through connections to their communities and the sustainable reusable of items.

The service will also help to generate awareness and understanding of the philosophies and causes local non-profits organizations to support. Through the platform, organizations can reach out and connect to the members of the community.

## Current implementation
The app is currently built using React Native and reads data from a JSON file that includes potential information about an organization. The foundation is set where we have screens in place for what we would like to show to the user which is all detailed in the link for the project.

## Future implementation
* Setup Firebase to distribute the app for testing
* Add a database and create a middle-tier for the information using Google Cloud and App Engine
* Find a way to add events such as fundraisers and so on for organizations
... and more
